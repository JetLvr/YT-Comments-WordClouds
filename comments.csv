KL CHAI,"War is cruel, and it is something that every individual does not want to experience personally, but if this war is your own choice, then you cannot blame the initiator of the war, because before the other party launched this war, countless Over the years, under your master's plan, you have launched a devastating war against the opponent and are preparing for it..

The Ukrainians themselves chose this war because the government you support is under the control of the American master. The American government is launching all kinds of provocations, confrontations and wars against the world all the time, all the time thinking about how to turn its imaginary enemy ruthless. Kill and let it disappear from the world, especially for Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, etc. Ukrainians leave their own destiny under the control of the US government, do not want to control their own destiny in their own hands, and do things that endanger the security of other countries for a long time, that's fine, since you don't want to control your own destiny, now the Russians have come to help you control your destiny. Although it is cruel to say this, I have to say that this war was completely brought by you Ukrainians, you deserved it, this is the outcome of the provocation, how this war will end, is also in your own hands, but obviously the Ukrainian government is still dreaming of being able to defeat Russia with its super stupid ideas, vulnerable strength and support from other countries, Completely ignoring one's own strength, position, right and wrong, reasonable and unreasonable, humanized and dehumanized, the security of the country and the people, etc., is a wrong path to the end, the sad Ukrainian government and people, You really brought this war on your own, and you deserve death and destruction, In the far east, there is a small island that belongs to China but is currently self-governing, the administrators of Taiwan, who, like you Ukrainians, are under the control of the American masters, ignorantly doing everything they can to provoke the Chinese Communist government. It is stupid to think that the United States, the common enemy of mankind, can give you all the protection, without considering your own abilities and all the favors, kindness and tolerance that the other party has given to you, who are of the same origin and the same language, but the ignorance on Taiwan Island The person is so lucky, because the Chinese Communist Party will not eliminate all kinds of provocations from the ignorant island in a Russian-like war, but I absolutely hope that the Chinese government will bring the ignorant island people into its own management as soon as possible, and reduce the number of conflict, harassment from the USA--United States of Arm..",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVUvqtdtr7YZK6R_860xyQ,ABC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UarBjS832A0

bunny jin,"Russia are wrong. Clearly. My heart goes out to the oridanry Ukrainians. But the entire west were the catalyst for this war . The west broke the Minsk agreement to not expand NATO. They pushed for Ukraine to join NATO. They egged on a Ukrainian gov that was put in power by a coup in 2014, supported by the West, which overthrew a gov in Ukraine that had good relations with Russia. There is an endless list. The BBC almost never mention any of this. Nor the Washington Post. The New York Times etc. etc. Peace was such an easy alternative. Put Ukraine off limits to NATO.  Yet western leaders ( and BJ) gets plaudits for so called caring. The west wanted this war and have followed America's crazy confrontational policies. If you know anything about geopolitical balance this is obvious. They have thrown Ukraine under the bus deliberately. Europe is now more expensive. Europe is less stable. The Ukraine is being devastated. No major world leader is clear of any moral blame. None. Britain's Boris Johnson is a serial liar and I guess very much happy that this war has got him off the hook for his lies to the whole country and the Queen. Biden can shore up flaggin popularity. America can step in and take advantage of Russian's absense to control the energy market. It is all so despicable. How can any European leader see this as helpful? We are bereft of wise and prudent leadership. Iraq. Afghanistan. Libya. Recent disasters. And here is another one. I am totally sickened. Prayers to the ordinary Ukrainians.

ClaraBamOne,This is just heartbreaking. I don't have enough words to express how I feel about this. But I hope this war ends soon for the sake of the innocent people... for the children and for humanity. I pray for peace for the world. But im afraid that the reality is that humanity is will not ever be in peace. There will always be conflict between countries unfortunately. We are too selfish and its al about power greed money etc. May God shed light upon everyone so there will be a resolution and so no more people get killed. I view any war as act of terrorism because that is what the people ultimately feel sheer terror and helplessness. Its all so tragic. Its all so evil.,main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHHz7amVJ8BIkEim9zTh8dQ,ABC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UarBjS832A0

Yet the wrong people are in power right now, and a boiling point could indeed be reached in that someone could fire a nuke and set off a chain reaction response. It's an impossible situation with an even more impossible solution, and Russia knows this and its why their doing what their doing sadly.

KL CHAI,"War is cruel, and it is something that every individual does not want to experience personally, but if this war is your own choice, then you cannot blame the initiator of the war, because before the other party launched this war, countless Over the years, under your master's plan, you have launched a devastating war against the opponent and are preparing for it...

The Ukrainians themselves chose this war because the government you support is under the control of the American master. The American government is launching all kinds of provocations, confrontations and wars against the world all the time, all the time thinking about how to turn its imaginary enemy ruthless. Kill and let it disappear from the world, especially for Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, etc. Ukrainians leave their own destiny under the control of the US government, do not want to control their own destiny in their own hands, and do things that endanger the security of other countries for a long time, that's fine, since you don't want to control your own destiny, now the Russians have come to help you control your destiny. Although it is cruel to say this, I have to say that this war was completely brought by you Ukrainians, you deserved it, this is the outcome of the provocation, how this war will end, is also in your own hands, but obviously the Ukrainian government is still dreaming of being able to defeat Russia with its super stupid ideas, vulnerable strength and support from other countries, Completely ignoring one's own strength, position, right and wrong, reasonable and unreasonable, humanized and dehumanized, the security of the country and the people, etc., is a wrong path to the end, the sad Ukrainian government and people, You really brought this war on your own, and you deserve death and destruction, In the far east, there is a small island that belongs to China but is currently self-governing, the administrators of Taiwan, who, like you Ukrainians, are under the control of the American masters, ignorantly doing everything they can to provoke the Chinese Communist government. It is stupid to think that the United States, the common enemy of mankind, can give you all the protection, without considering your own abilities and all the favors, kindness and tolerance that the other party has given to you, who are of the same origin and the same language, but the ignorance on Taiwan Island The person is so lucky, because the Chinese Communist Party will not eliminate all kinds of provocations from the ignorant island in a Russian-like war, but I absolutely hope that the Chinese government will bring the ignorant island people into its own management as soon as possible, and reduce the number of conflict, harassment from the USA--United States of Arm.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVUvqtdtr7YZK6R_860xyQ,CNN,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a3PQgD-LrA

It's also not easy to sanction the most powerful economy in the world and it wouldn't make sense for NATO to sanction their strongest member to help a non-NATO country. Russia is not nearly on the same level as the US economically, in this scenario they are the little country with their only advantage being the wests fear of nuclear war.

TalonTed," @Franklin   Firstly, by definition Russia is not a superpower. Superpowers don't solely exercise power through military force despite what your made up definition states. Secondly, the fighting will likely be done through proxy which is what has been done before and what we currently see happening now though it is increasingly becoming inevitable that a full  scale war may breakout. China doesn't need to ""start expanding"" as they have already been doing so for years. If Ukraine was a NATO country Russia likely wouldn't have attacked. Russia only really attacks it's neighbors and failing regimes it's had alliances with prior to the disillution of the USSR. Regardless, this war will hurt Russia in the long run as the sanctions are already crashing their economy. They're being backed into a corner, it's anyone's guess what happens next.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKt1I_8i48VA5BhY_c6Ozjg,CNN,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a3PQgD-LrA

Mr Smartypants,Talk is cheap.  However the west is eating Putin and Russia like an invasive incurable disease. Slow and steady. And the only way to stop the spread of this disease is for Russians to come to the conclusion that Putin must be put to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù.   The actions the west is taking will absolutely gut Russia in the next year or two.  Without firing a shot.   Putin could stop Russia‚Äôs destruction and decay anytime he decides but his sociopathic narcissism won‚Äôt let him consider his own people.  Much like Trump.  Except Trump ruled a republic and that republic kicked him out of office.

Anthony Pape,"I'm starting to come around to the US helping militarily.  Here's why.  1. This is the first country that has actually asked for our help since Churchill in WW2.  So although we (whoever was in power at the time) may have had delusions of being greated as liberators, speaders of democracy, humanitarians, nothing could be further from the truth.  And it turns out every war we have participated in since WW2  with ne exception, (NATO going after Milosovich for begining to have a holocaust against Kosovo civilians) we have gotton whipped.  In fact I can't name a war in which the agressor won and held the area long term.  2.  The more decisively we push Russian forces back, the less will die.  3. England, France, Germany, Israel, would have to also go in and we would have to get authorization from the UN.  3. It's the right thing to do.  But we don't beause how does a nuclear power fight another nuclear power? 4.   I think the last requirement of us doing this would be to get an international law passed stating use or the retaliatory use of nukees is illegal.  In fact any use of nukes is ill3gal.  And then get a clear and severe (wayward pines) penalty for any country who breaks this law.  For example example you will immediately attacked by every military on Earth.  The president or who ordered the attack will be jailed so he can watch his country dismantled, renamed and divided amoungst the countries that were nuked and those that defeated it.  That president would then go through the ordeal of being broken on the Catherine wheel so he can be rolled through the newly formed countries born out of his former country.    That's just an example but somthing clear - ask anyone ane they know the penalty and sever so that everyone agrees I feel sorry for the fool thay breaks this law.",main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzbog4DUU0F4YxZUf2luJw,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDtCOtTOQ2g

The injustice of CH, EN, NL living richer lives than Russia, is due to Putin not sharing the riches of the country with his people. He grabbed the riches with a group of friends, who are now millionaires and billionaires.

Apparently, the Russian military does not have the logistical capability to do this. They are hungry, tired and scared. Not a good thing for the troops in the field.

J.B. MacAdam," @Hydross :  You are incorrect. The Russian high command apparently did not expect this war to continue as long as it has. They did not assemble a sufficient logistical train. Russian vehicles have been filmed stranded on the side of the road, with Russian soldiers stating that they are out of fuel. This never happened to this old Soldier in my military service. The sight of Russian soldiers looting food stuffs is not a good sign for the Russian military effort. As for your question 'why not'?

But oh no you guys can run over people in tanks and drop unguided mortars on entire buildings and kill children and people that used to go to work and live normal everyday. Putin wanted to start this war so he could try and flex but Ukraine is making all yall Russians look like fools. That's why most of yall are ashamed of yourselves. Hahaha must be why russia hacked the election if that's even true because he couldn't do this under Trump. Long live Ukraine. Russia ain't gonna break them and let russia cross 1 border of a nato country. It will be game over for russia. Putin can't see us in straight up war. Threatens nukes because HE is the 1 that is scared. He thinks that will make us fall back but we have the same amount of nukes so they send 1 we will send everything.

If you have a family would you go out and protest knowing you will be put in prison for 10-15 years. They also know that when they are released from prison everything will still be the same. So I understand not protesting and keeping the mouth shut. That is not the US. I respect them for that. I have 3 kids and a wife and I would not protest if I knew I would go to prison because who would take care of my family. Who would provide for them. It‚Äôs easy to sit here in the US where we are free and condemn those that won‚Äôt speak out. I don‚Äôt know what to say to people living in a country that lives like that.

Maria Sechi,"The words of Karolina Francov, Donbass writer.

‚ÄúMany ask me why I don't publish anything about what is happening in Ukraine. Why don't I comment and say what I think.



Then I answer. This is not because I feel upset or scared and definitely not because I don't have the courage to speak. And that I don't see the point of speaking. I talked a lot in 2014, 15, 16‚Ä¶ when Ukraine exterminated civilians in Donbass by the hundreds. Indeed, I shouted when the city where my mother lives was bombed, when the pieces of meat‚Ä¶ legs, arms, heads of children and old people were literally scattered on the sidewalks and in the parks. I felt like I was living in hell when I saw the satisfied and smiling faces of my Ukrainian ""friends"" at the sight of the photos of the corpses ... those of Odessa, those people burned alive. Now. Now I feel emotionally anesthetized. I struggle to be empathetic. I feel embarrassed when friends tell me about the shock and fear they feel, because I don't feel anything anymore. For 8 long years my mother heard the gunshots, howls of bombs and the news of new dead. Donbass people are used to it. All this has become a daily routine. Has anyone prayed for them? Someone of you? Or maybe the American president? Or Europe? Do you know what the people of Lugansk are saying? I tell you: God bless Vladimir Putin and Russia.

Barak Obama in his two terms on average dropped a bomb every two minutes during his presidency , how many of those were military targets ? Where is your outcry to declare him a war criminal ? His administration funded the 2014 coup in Ukraine , and directly sent those nazi battalions you say don't exist , money , weapons , equipment , and U.S. personnel to train them.

bunny jin,"Russia are wrong. Clearly. My heart goes out to the oridanry Ukrainians. But the entire west were the catalyst for this war . The west broke the Minsk agreement to not expand NATO. They pushed for Ukraine to join NATO. They egged on a Ukrainian gov that was put in power by a coup in 2014, supported by the West, which overthrew a gov in Ukraine that had good relations with Russia. There is an endless list. The BBC almost never mention any of this. Nor the Washington Post. The New York Times etc. etc. Peace was such an easy alternative. Put Ukraine off limits to NATO.  Yet western leaders ( and BJ) gets plaudits for so called caring. The west wanted this war and have followed America's crazy confrontational policies. If you know anything about geopolitical balance this is obvious. They have thrown Ukraine under the bus deliberately. Europe is now more expensive. Europe is less stable. The Ukraine is being devastated. No major world leader is clear of any moral blame. None. Britain's Boris Johnson is a serial liar and I guess very much happy that this war has got him off the hook for his lies to the whole country and the Queen. Biden can shore up flaggin popularity. America can step in and take advantage of Russian's absense to control the energy market. It is all so despicable. How can any European leader see this as helpful? We are bereft of wise and prudent leadership. Iraq. Afghanistan. Libya. Recent disasters. And here is another one. I am totally sickened. Prayers to the ordinary Ukrainians.

Ukraine was pumped up with weapons even without having membership in NATO, and it was according to this scheme that the United States wanted to arrange a military conflict between Ukraine and Russia, because through the controlled president Zelensky (deputy of the Ukrainian Senate Ilya Kiva: ""Zelensky has $ 1.2 billion in the bank of Costa Rica, and this despite the fact that 2 years ago he was an ordinary humorist"") Ukraine has adopted the doctrine - ""to return Crimea at any cost, including military force.""

KL CHAI,"War is cruel, and it is something that every individual does not want to experience personally, but if this war is your own choice, then you cannot blame the initiator of the war, because before the other party launched this war, countless Over the years, under your master's plan, you have launched a devastating war against the opponent and are preparing for it.

The Ukrainians themselves chose this war because the government you support is under the control of the American master. The American government is launching all kinds of provocations, confrontations and wars against the world all the time, all the time thinking about how to turn its imaginary enemy ruthless. Kill and let it disappear from the world, especially for Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, etc. Ukrainians leave their own destiny under the control of the US government, do not want to control their own destiny in their own hands, and do things that endanger the security of other countries for a long time, that's fine, since you don't want to control your own destiny, now the Russians have come to help you control your destiny. Although it is cruel to say this, I have to say that this war was completely brought by you Ukrainians, you deserved it, this is the outcome of the provocation, how this war will end, is also in your own hands, but obviously the Ukrainian government is still dreaming of being able to defeat Russia with its super stupid ideas, vulnerable strength and support from other countries, Completely ignoring one's own strength, position, right and wrong, reasonable and unreasonable, humanized and dehumanized, the security of the country and the people, etc., is a wrong path to the end, the sad Ukrainian government and people, You really brought this war on your own, and you deserve death and destruction, In the far east, there is a small island that belongs to China but is currently self-governing, the administrators of Taiwan, who, like you Ukrainians, are under the control of the American masters, ignorantly doing everything they can to provoke the Chinese Communist government. It is stupid to think that the United States, the common enemy of mankind, can give you all the protection, without considering your own abilities and all the favors, kindness and tolerance that the other party has given to you, who are of the same origin and the same language, but the ignorance on Taiwan Island The person is so lucky, because the Chinese Communist Party will not eliminate all kinds of provocations from the ignorant island in a Russian-like war, but I absolutely hope that the Chinese government will bring the ignorant island people into its own management as soon as possible, and reduce the number of conflict, harassment from the USA--United States of Arm.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVUvqtdtr7YZK6R_860xyQ,Channel 4 News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxpsLvtV_A

KL CHAI,"War is cruel, and it is something that every individual does not want to experience personally, but if this war is your own choice, then you cannot blame the initiator of the war, because before the other party launched this war, countless Over the years, under your master's plan, you have launched a devastating war against the opponent and are preparing for it.

The Ukrainians themselves chose this war because the government you support is under the control of the American master. The American government is launching all kinds of provocations, confrontations and wars against the world all the time, all the time thinking about how to turn its imaginary enemy ruthless. Kill and let it disappear from the world, especially for Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, etc. Ukrainians leave their own destiny under the control of the US government, do not want to control their own destiny in their own hands, and do things that endanger the security of other countries for a long time, that's fine, since you don't want to control your own destiny, now the Russians have come to help you control your destiny. Although it is cruel to say this, I have to say that this war was completely brought by you Ukrainians, you deserved it, this is the outcome of the provocation, how this war will end, is also in your own hands, but obviously the Ukrainian government is still dreaming of being able to defeat Russia with its super stupid ideas, vulnerable strength and support from other countries, Completely ignoring one's own strength, position, right and wrong, reasonable and unreasonable, humanized and dehumanized, the security of the country and the people, etc., is a wrong path to the end, the sad Ukrainian government and people, You really brought this war on your own, and you deserve death and destruction, In the far east, there is a small island that belongs to China but is currently self-governing, the administrators of Taiwan, who, like you Ukrainians, are under the control of the American masters, ignorantly doing everything they can to provoke the Chinese Communist government. It is stupid to think that the United States, the common enemy of mankind, can give you all the protection, without considering your own abilities and all the favors, kindness and tolerance that the other party has given to you, who are of the same origin and the same language, but the ignorance on Taiwan Island The person is so lucky, because the Chinese Communist Party will not eliminate all kinds of provocations from the ignorant island in a Russian-like war, but I absolutely hope that the Chinese government will bring the ignorant island people into its own management as soon as possible, and reduce the number of conflict, harassment from the USA--United States of Arm.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVUvqtdtr7YZK6R_860xyQ,Channel 4 News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxpsLvtV_A

Pilek01, @Joel H  The difference is Ukrainians are European and they go to the first safe country and will go back to rebuild their country then the war is over. The migrants from middle east want to come and stay forever and get benefits and not work at all. Also why don't they go to their neighbor country's in the middle easy? Another point is that Ukrainian refugees are 90% women and children and the men go back to defend the country. The refuges from middle east were mostly young men running away and leaving their women behind. see the difference?,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYdUABMmsb-axFpPu-9R9gg,CNN,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsBc_Vbt1Uw

Anja G Semmler," @northern light  actually its not the US Citizens ""fault"" absolutely not, and I do not say such either.... however the fact that ""prior to all this"" (which no ones talking about and slipping it quietly under the carpet is):  Hunter Biden & his father (whom are supposed to represent the US citizens interest, not their private interests) just so happened to have made private Gas deals with Ukrainian President promising the politically inexperienced barely 44 yr old and his Regime ""the forever living glory of riches beyond their wildest dreams"" , if he join forces of selling out the European Gaspipeline, all this PRIOR TO THE ELECTION and to furthermore then change the Ukrainian culture to a more modern western culture after the election win, and allow military stations; yeah I'd pretty much say it has something to do with the fact that his regime afterwards went ballistic on citizens and let this awaited glory go to his head, then began to Nazify the people there, neighborhood by neighborhood, killing off anyone whom dare open their mouths about what's really going on there - all for the sake of living the American dream in Ukraine instead of in America... and that harassment of citizens since 2014 at which point Donbas (being primarily Russian born) kept contacting Russia begging for help because Russia IS THEIR Motherland, and not a damned thing any of us can do to change that fact! Now, of course many only see the aftermath... and blaming 1 man, whom has been in Office for 23 years, politically has run a huge country such as Russia for many years and ""never once"" has done ANYTHING to the Homeland of the USA! Never invaded, never threatened to invade, never run his mouth about how big his guns are or the likes thereof, never harmed any of you. And no one is asking the main question: why all of the sudden this blank hatred against this 1 man, meanwhile in Yemen people are being slaughtered daily, 150.000 adults and 50,000 small children up to date, and no one's saying a bloody word since 2011?

M W," @EWaste  Most cities have 2 weeks of supply. There is no chance the Ukraine population has food or water on hand for 40 million people. The scenario you create is one of a siege where the city has had weeks or months to store supplies under military guidance. Such as Leningrad where Putins' brother died in the siege. Once the stores get bombed they will be looted by the citizens themselves. The economic conditions in Russia are livable for the foreseeable future.

Why do you say that the report is in a helicopter? They could be in or on a tall building at the edge of a city or town, on a water town, or any other piece of infrastructure.

As for the coincidence, parts of Ukraine are a war zone so expecting a military helicopter to fly by would not be unexpected, especially if one knew the area and could determine the best places for helicopters to fly.

It‚Äôs not deep, it‚Äôs literally the basis of why we exist the way we do, it‚Äôs the basis of why we perpetuate war. War is almost always a response to fear. Even now, Putin will say this war is in response to aggressive behavior from the west and the people of Ukraine, and his inner circle may say it‚Äôs due to the need for expansion, that there is an opportunity to close the gap between Russia and NATO, but the reality is that he‚Äôs been backed into a corner by his own deeds and has nothing left to do but attack. It‚Äôs fear disguised as confidence.

No I don't believe there's a cameraman up in a helicopter, in fact (as I said in one of my comments) to me it looks as though the camera is not hand-held, from the way it pans to the right in two distinct sweeps, looks like its electrically/electronically controlled. Also if you look at the fact that the view from the camera is downwards towards the helicopter and its well above the treeline, it's either in some kind of sky-scraper (which, being in a semi-rural area, I doubt) or attached to a very tall tower.

We wanted Russia to be a good little minion of ours and obey our orders. Now it's blowing up in our faces.

My friend I‚Äôve been following this war for the past 8 years, and you‚Äôve been following it for the past 8 days and yet you you‚Äôve got the nerve to lecture me. You only learned about it because western MSM decided to tell you...and what they tell you is LIES. Ukraine for 8 years has been attacking, killing and oppressing the people of Donbass. They killed 15,000 people and launched 2 major wars against the Donbass, both unsuccessfully. I didn‚Äôt see you ever complain about it? Where was your compassion then? Why only now you show your compassion to Nazi junkie regime of Kyiv? Not once did the west tell you what was really happening in Ukraine. They kept it quiet for 8 long years. But now Russia has said enough is enough and took action to bring the war to an end....and this is the moment the fascist MSM decided to open its mouth and call ‚ÄúRussian aggression‚Äù. Don‚Äôt you want the war to end? Then support Russia and stop being intellectually lazy. The people of Ukraine have a right to live in a world free from Nazi thugs, free from warmongers. They want and need peace....not an invitation to join NATO to start a global war against Russia.

Instead of trying to place people in neat boxes why dont you be silent for a moment and consider that every nation has done things that have had devastating consequences for another nation.

He should have urged his people opposed to the invasion to accept it, because it is inevitable the Russian takeover will succeed.

At least you question it, that is a good sign for you as a person, but don't bother  wasting your energy much on it, live and enjoy your life. BBC could make such stories for Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yugoslavia, but chose not to. USA became strong because of Petro Dollar, and on Military interventions so as to take resources of other countries, while at the same time promote Capitalism, Democracy and most importantly economy of competition, but that economy can start only when they take all the main resources and bring other nations to knees and let them compete on who makes better burgers or coffee. Unfortunately for USA and Monopolists such as Rothschilds and other such families, they woke up a sleeping bear and now they can just watch. Only problem is what comes next is that we dont know and its going to affect you, me and ordinary people while Monopolists and Oligarchs are gonna still stay strong making decisions in their own interest.

Just because people share heritage doesn't mean they want to operate the same way. I think that's clear with how the Ukrainians are fighting for their way of life.
Civil conflicts are complex, mainly because countries are formed with the concept of unity not eventual division in mind, making legality and civility in seperation difficult. I don't agree with a lot of the actions that western countries have taken in the past, including my own.

Franky Honnolus, @WomanOfSteel  what international law constituted our invasion to Iraq and Lybia? What international law justified our killings of innocent people in the region?

Scott Lebens," @Franky Honnolus The idea of the USSR does not stretch back 1000 years. In fact a large part of Ukraine was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which was in conflict with what would be Russia today. So no such unity in the region for the time span you speak of can really be claimed. And I agree that the USA had no right to wage many of the wars it did. But just because Western nations commited crimes in the past is no defence for countries, including Western ones, to commit those acts now.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkMdBBpX1wmvdh9hBEM3wRg,Channel 4 News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1WyGhqMx1M

So in a given attack with multiple ICBMs 100 active war heads along with many dummy warheads will be aimed at an enemy nation, the shear number will most likely overwhelm any defence system.

Maret Hyu," @sandra casso  We need to see the full picture. We can't just be talking about NATO as a military allience while ignoring Europe's politics for the last few decades. 
EU should have pushed for and encouraged economic unity with Eastern Europe when Gorbachev gave them the chance. After all the Washington treaty's goal to create a balancing power against the Soviet Union was followed by the need for multilateralism in Europe. However, the EU was too busy importing cheap workforce from countries they destroyed in Africa and Middle East, and blowing social ""issues"" out of proportion for political following.

Ian Mastin," @Electric Chair  Putin has already stated his idea of Ukranian ""independance"" is to dismantle the democraticaly elected government and replace it with a series of federal districts and decentralize the leadership of the country turning it into a puppeted extension of Russia. Putin doesnt want Ukraine to join NATO for obvious defensive reasons but he also doesnt want Ukraine to remaine independant for less obvious reasons. Something like 90% of Russias GDP comes from its trade of oil gas and energy, Its been fairly recently discovered that Ukraine sits on several large pockets of oil and gas... now Ukraine cant afford to directly persue these resources so up till recently Russia wasnt worried abou it but when Ukraine started partnering with Western companies like Shell to come in and finance the access to those resources Putin got worried. If Ukraine were able to access those resources by partnering with the west it would become a direct competitor to Russias oil and gas industry selling directly to Europe and being that it has better relations to the EU and NATO than Russia this would futher degrade Russias position of power while strengthaning Ukraines.... Putin will not allow that to happen and Russia can not afford it. This it why Russia targeted Crimea and why its targetting the eastern regions of Ukraine and the energy sector of Ukraine... its about the resources.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMI8rq3Xw2hcGJkz5eY-NEw,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq6-WCAWxMQ

Paying terrorists 10.5 million x 3-4 times and then using the war act as his first line of negotiations with the most peaceful protest in remembrance? Encouraging division violence slander and war. Mandating experimental vaccines that are now proving to be deadly. Yet the elite tripled their money while citizens lost their businesses their lives or their community? Ignoring science and running away from the people to hide like a spoilt child who never learned to deal. He has worked against woman in his cabinet . Even men who don't agree, good friends who have an opinion he betrays them. So this is you super hero eh? What kind of human are you?

bountylad,I agree. The west needs to stop cheering the President of Ukraine on to get his people killed . Instead they should be responsible and talk some sense into him. This is like Hammas going up against the Israeli army with their makeshift rockets and Iran cheering them on telling them they are winning instead of telling them the truth that they cannot win and that they should consider negotiating to save the lives of innocent citizens caught in the middle. Calling innocent civilians to pick up arms against the Russian army is a sure way to get them obliterated. The only good thing saving them up to this point is that the Russians have so far been restraining themselves or else a lot more innocent citizens would be dead based on the capabilities of the Russian army. If Russia took the approach of the US to rely mostly on air strikes to minimize the number of soldiers killed then much more innocent Ukrainians would be dead right now. Sometimes it is braver if you compromise with the enemy to safe the life of your people.

Munaf Ghori,My view on Russia & Ukraine war is that Russia have a right to invade Ukraine to demilitarise it for their own security. Because Nato and America has bad intention. Their intention is to contain and curb and control Russia by allowing Ukraine to join Nato. If Ukraine joins nato then it will provoke Russia and starts the third world war. As America invades Iraq on th lies that Iraq had wmd and this they take as right to invade Iraq but it was all lies. So Russia too have concenrs that if Ukraine join nato then this will allow nato and amrica to put their military and nuclear weapon near Russian border and this then may provide russia. So Russia is directly protecting their nation and indirectly trying to avoid any future war which may involves all countries of the world and this may be last war which can finish all life on earth...,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk42oWH2PyEPGfp-FUwmZJQ,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzR_K2tEXSo

They egged on a Ukrainian gov that was put in power by a coup in 2014, supported by the West, which overthrew a gov in Ukraine that had good relations with Russia. There is an endless list. Peace was such an easy alternative. Put Ukraine off limits to NATO.  Yet western leaders ( and BJ) gets plaudits for so called caring. The west wanted this war and have followed America's crazy confrontational policies. If you know anything about geopolitical balance this is obvious. They have thrown Ukraine under the bus deliberately. Europe is now more expensive. Europe is less stable. The Ukraine is being devastated. No major world leader is clear of any moral blame. None. Britain's Boris Johnson is a serial liar and I guess very much happy that this war has got him off the hook for his lies to the whole country and the Queen. Biden can shore up flaggin popularity. America can step in and take advantage of Russian's absense to control the energy market. It is all so despicable. How can any European leader see this as helpful?

Leo Alexander,"While it may be quite a ways down the road, I really, really hope this leads to some fundamental changes in how the UN functions and addresses international crises. Those diplomats that left in protest when the Russian spokesman Lavrov addressed the chamber shows how utterly powerless the UN is if the best it can do to counter a permanent Security Council member with veto powers is to throw shade their way rather than taking any sort of meaningful action. The UN will never be anything more than a 'League of Nations: Part II' if it has no teeth to back up resolutions. Clearly, if its purpose is the foster peace an prevent war, then it's an abject failure and will continue to be until the most powerful countries are willing to give up some degree of autonomy for their defence to the greater, international community. Ideally, under the circumstances playing out now, the Security Council members would band together, combining their military might, and halt the invasion. Obviously Russia's veto power prevents their actions from even being condemned, let alone stopped; but even in an ideal scenario, direct intervention against a nuclear power is next to impossible short of a world war and potential nuclear holocaust. While the idea of a heavily armed UN might seem hawkish and unsettling, I think it's far less so than the 'might makes right' result of numerous, heavily-armed member states. It can't impact the current crisis, but perhaps if we move in the direction of a UN that resembles a loose confederation with the authority to use a military entirely separate from that of its constituents. Otherwise the organization is an outated waste of time.",main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNdDnJMb4NgNc7HmdiCWy6A,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddx154BUHmE

NATO should come clear on its intentions. If it wants to support Ukraine, then it should include Ukraine as one of its members and send its military to defend the country. Period. Or else, it should fully withdraw itself from the matter. Russia has made it clear that it won't sit quietly. And Russia only understands the language of power.

E.g. bomb Serbs in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro for no legitimate reason (Serbs did not attack any NATO member).
When USSR asked to join NATO in early years when NATO was created, NATO rejected them. So USSR confirmed to themselves what NATO is all about. So then USSR went on and made their own pact. I'm Serbian from Belgrade, so I felt the love of NATO in 1999. We were never in any pact, we were not aligned. Russians have not ""saved us"" from NATO then. We were left alone. NATO asked for some crazy things in order to stop bombing us, but at the end we only had to remove our army from our south region.

Dude, are you comparing a force of 2-minute noodles with a real fighting force that has the experience of fighting not just one but many wars? Seriously?

Such was the humiliation that it had to use a bunch of TikTokers in uniforms instead of its 2-minute-noodle army to hide its embarassment. LOL.China only has more cheap quality weapons but that doesn't make it a military superpower. India is a nuclear triad and we have the capability if hitting Beijing to send it to a state of roast. India hasn't lost a war since 1965, and it includes 3 encounters with China - in 1967, in 2017, and in 2021. On the contrary, China got a thrashing at the hands of Vietnam and ran away from the battlefield in 1979. A full-fledged war with India would be akin to a suicide or a harakiri act by China. We don't need military support. All we need is sophisticated weapons. We've partnered with the US only for this purpose. If the US stops selling us weapons, well we have many other options.

Avwon," @Steve Wing  you are delusional, I just read your Tech Camp transcript and its mind boggling how you can take a simple organisation that teaches effective and transparent media journalism into some sort of secret US operative coup-training camp. Its a fairytale clear as day, little stories of the kremlin gremlins, but you have no idea how to judge what is truthful and what is fictional. Somehow there is always some secret ploy somewhere, some sort of operatives being trained here, some behadings there, secret labs over there, and some Nazi regime in a country where the far right ""Svoboda"" party barely has 1 parliament seat out of 450 seats... that is 0.002% representation, and the Kremlin propaganda was able to use this and a niche ""Azov"" battalion of less than 20% Neo-Nazis within its 2,500 unit regiment out of 240,000+ active Ukrainian military service members, only a representation of less than 0.004%, to make Ukraine out as some Nazi state. Does are the numbers and the facts. You are an absolute fool. Thats like saying the US should be invaded for it having some fringe K-K-K or White Supremacists. You fell for some fancy stories that Putin is shoving down your throat when there is no fact but only fiction to support this delusion, all so his people can more easily stomach the fact that they are going to war to kill their own relatives, and the rest of the world sees and knows this while you and your feeble mind think you are uncovering some world wide conspiracy.

i think he try using others for his shield,, so if something happend at them zelenskyy can pick and use it for his defend argument.. why can't you think about this zelenskyy lies why you so dumb and not thinking all of this, 8 years russian told him to stop attacking civillian people in donbass, why no media rolling this issue the real issue but no media only talk about ""SEPARATIST"" and ""CIVIL WAR"" never about the real stories army and local people.. i think only RT and other small news talk about this but not many.. zelenskyy breaking the secuarity agreement with russia and its not small thing .. but people dont understand this, lets move on beside that about joinning NATO, you need to understand ukrainian energy mineral gas electricity everything mostly overall 80% are from russia if zelenskyy did that it will effect russia economy as we already know russian ruble are crumble and slowly drop in value before so putin dont lets it happend..  he have no choice even with this sanctions its make no diffrent.. only little bit its will effect ordinary civillian people.. think about this if this is really russian fault and putin breaking the international law other nation esspecially EU already got involve 3 month ago they already stand for ukraine and take action way more early.. but they're not,, they only act after russian army already get inside kiev and most are related with humanitarian action between russian army and ukrainian people who got trapped by zelenskyy action and plans.. there must be something in between that we dont know about.. just look at how the world politic game are playing its just not connect and most what i saw on the news are just nonsense .. now the world only can watch talk talk talk on the news support with small arm and medic and talk to media to their cattle who consuming the BS. for the people who talk about its because the russian have more nukes please stop stop stop and go learn about VETO power and international laws before talking nonsense .. zelenskyy is the one who responsible on blowing up nuclear power plant to get EU attention so they can get involve and can send personal on land and western media keep this lies for people like you to belive its russian army who blown up nuclear plant . nonsense, if russia do that it just give them more problem with nuclear mess that are closed to their country and get more problem with other EU nation because EU have agreement and responsibility take care on that too and if russia really do that they got no benefits from it after the war.. thats why its was the first thing russian take over and care before kiev and others city because they dont want a mess thats can make other nation got involved for their operation and what i've seen on media they really trying to hides the truth from the public and twisting the news tittle to point it out at russia . on RT news russian defense minister have already talk about it but others news still not showed his speech about the issue .. what i can see from the western news western are really trying to get involved (military) using the media and human right issue.. i belive many thing will happend after this.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQOkdw7684QCU9zX214cKWQ,VICE News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk5DgCwdTCw

In Tallinn, more old buildings remain vs Narva but my own family home was a soviet block in the middle of old town where medieval buildings had been destroyed in WWII. My great grandfather had two major apartment buildings in the centre of the town, destroyed. The National Opera house, destroyed, and so forth. Kadrioru Castle remains (the one built by Peter  the Great) I would say mainly because it was nowhere close to residential areas but in a vaaaast empty park. Tallinn also capitulated so that is why it was not razed to ground, although it was tragically damaged. Check your facts man. In Narva, 1, I say 1 (!) baroque building remains, the City Hall.  Narva was utterly destroyed.

Limon Cello," @The ACME Movement  understand. The problem here is that Moscow already broke that deal when it tried to put a puppet president in Ukraine that could enable the control from Kremlin, hence enlarging Moscow influence beyond Russian borders. Apparently Ukrainians did not like that much. And that was no NATO approaching Russia, it was Russia approaching Ukraine, which has a tremendous animosity against Kremlin. Problem is that none of the Baltic republics will ever give up to their membership in NATO since for them it is a precious gem that guarantee their security against the forever predatory impulses of the Kremlin.

The UN organization has lost its effective role today, it has already fulfilled its functions, it cannot work with new problems, it does not have the legitimacy that it possessed in the last century, today the main decisions are put forward in favor of the United States, which should not be in fact. The USA must remain without the support of the SSNS, the mind on planet Earth must win. The SSNS site should be located in Moscow, its goal is to eradicate fascism in any form on the whole Earth. This platform will give countries the legitimacy to conduct special operations against Nazism, it will create a new image of Russia, it will destroy the image of fascism in people's minds, it will help Russians and all Christians around the world, and not only us, it will help undecided.

After you expressed your hope that it would respect your autonomy over your own business, it became furious and dispatched its employees, along with the underworld, to attack your department store, injuring or even killing your family. Then a passer-by said that you shouldn't offend the big department store next door, and criticized your family for not knowing how to run a business and even employing people inappropriately, saying that the big department store next door to you is a hero, saying it's your fault, You forced it to attack you, you were wrong, what do you think? it's wired! The muscular department store is so weak that even a snort can make it shock! Who is incompetent and who is inappropriate? Is it true that only big department stores are allowed to do business, and others will become troublemakers by joining chain stores to sell groceries for a living?

Ryan Fraser,"Residents of Ukraine!  You sold yourself for a European sausage back in 91, when you thought that you would live better than anyone, at the expense of the industry that the entire Union was building for you.  Both Russians and Tatars and Uzbeks and Chechens built on shabashki.  We have not forgotten about the debt, we will have to return it.  You never thought about brotherhood, only about your comfort and lacy panties.  According to the legal procedure, you just declared your independence, but legally it means nothing.  According to the law, exit is no longer possible - Russia, as the successor of the USSR, will not give permission for this.  Only war remains.  Ukrainians have never fought for sovereignty, the last major war, where 10 million Ukrainians died, was the war for the freedom of the Soviet Fatherland.  To rewrite the results of that war, we need a new one with losses of at least 10 million plus one person.  Then the RF will lower you on all 4 sides.  The Kurds have been fighting for their freedom for 200 years, the Ukrainians are just getting started.  Putin forbade bombing barracks and destroying Nazis inside residential areas.  We need the repeal of these orders and the conduct of the war as it is written in military textbooks.  You consider us slaves, but you are the slaves.  Slaves of their greed and frivolity.  While you were stuffing your gut and earning a little personal happiness, we hunchbacked in factories and created our future victory - weapons, army, navy.  You still don't know what real war is.  Pray for good Putin, and we are waiting for the order of the commander-in-chief to start a real war, not a special operation.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcCMTPGGJvNeuj15oDUd-9A,VICE News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li_NrhV5Nt8

Tim Norris,"I sympathise for those suffering in the Ukraine war.  It is terribly sad what has happened.

Part of the blame for the present war situation in Ukraine lies with the West for surrounding Russia with hostile nuclear weapons (NATO) and demonizing Russia.  The West has been pushing Russia to the limit with the intention of dismantling the Russian state with aim to plunder Russia's resources.  The US has depleted its oil resources; the US has now had to progress to low-yield expensive fracking.   With the US economy hugely in debt, the US is now eager to take over the Russian oil reserves and mineral resources.  The present Russian regime stands in the way of US' ambitions.  Whereas detente could have been successful in avoiding the war in Ukraine, the USA has precipitated the Ukrainian war by its US intransigence in recent negotiations.  The main stream media is biased and is conveniently avoiding this issue.  The war in Ukraine could easily have been avoided by detente.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIY4W6TJOuLy1d1RUSzEsnA,VICE News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li_NrhV5Nt8

Tim Norris," @Yassine Alami-  Tech Reviews  In that case, by Ukraine surrendering promptly, a lot of lives will be saved.  If the war continues, there will be a lot more suffering of innocent civilian population in Ukraine.  The West is pouring in arms because the West wants to perpetuate the war because it is good for the balance sheet and sales of military equipments companies.  The West does not care about the civilian population in Ukraine, any more than the Russians care. Both US and Russian superpowers are not concerned about the fate of the Ukrainian ordinary civil population.  It is all a big power struggle for oil and gas, ultimately.  We should be transitioning from oil & gas to renewables as quickly as possible.  Nuclear civil power is not the answer; there are 350, 000 tonnes of high level nuclear waste worldwide that is a terrible legacy to leave for future generations of humans.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIY4W6TJOuLy1d1RUSzEsnA,VICE News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li_NrhV5Nt8

Vince C.,"It's not the perfect example of being a human.  If that were what's going on, there would have been no need for war because there would be no borders, no greed, no thirst for power over other people or obtaining wealth through the misery of others.  We'd love each other the way we want to be loved, and we'd help those that were having a hard time at it. 
NO...not the perfect example of being human. It's the perfect example of bravery in the face of evil.  Pride for one's country and the willingness to DIE FREE before living life enslaved.  It's not letting evil prevail by the actions of good men who refuse to sit around and do nothing.  May God Bless all these brave people and keep his hand on them as they fight evil at their door steps.

There's nothing but death & destruction for the common man and wealth & prosperity for the warmongers. We see what happened in Kuwait/Iraq and Syria. What happened in Afghanistan. Why was there no fuming and unanimous support from the West back then? What about current day Yemen? What about Israel/Palestine? Why is it suddenly now that everyone is considered a hater if they don't support a war that we are all tired of seeing? Because it happened in another part of the globe for a change. If we have to fix things, it has to come from a genuine place of love. India got it's democracy through anti-violence.

Putin amassed a whole lot of troops on the Ukrainian border for I forget how long.  As a result, Ukraine put up defences and the rest of the world that is against invading neighbouring countries told putin not to do it. Putin, on the other hand played 'I'm not touching you' for a while and since nobody was doing anything, he simply invaded Ukraine and has been killing innocent civilians and attacking nuclear power stations ever since.  Keep up eBay, keep up.....  Also, as far as I know Mexico and Canada have armies, just like Ukraine does.

Crypto Cookie,"India has also dropped its dependence on Russian defense equipment by more than 53 % in the last decade. Even in future, if India doesn't trade with Russia, India will still never go against Russia because of cultural and friendly ties. Same applies to USA & Europe as well. India won't go against them even if there is no trade. Indians do not agree with American saying ""If you are not with us, then you're against us"". In India we say: ""If we are not with you, we're also not against you"". India will not provide weapon to one friend, when 2 of its friends are fighting. All India can do is to provide food & medical support to the injured and promote talks between the 2 fighting friends.  I think west needs to learn and should try to resolve matters diplomatically without escalation. Even after so much of war, destruction and innocent lives being sacrificed, you will sit and talk in the end. So why not do it before and save lives ?

Motherlover Mercantile, @Jim Davison  not sure what you mean but I‚Äôve been watching the neo-Nazi rise to power there and the US involvement in this mess lends to the reason we get only propaganda here in the states. I‚Äôve been writing a book on the rise of the fourth Reich and have no doubts of my knowledge of Ukrainian fingerprints on this. And no doubts of US and UK fingerprints on this. Do you have info that I have not seen?,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6e7m0ythAktbnnZnLCyF9A,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI

About LNR-DNR After the annexation of Crimea, it was necessary to continue the dismemberment of Ukraine, Yanukovych wanted to head the Kharkiv region. There, under the guise of tourists, Girkin &co arrived on buses from Belgorod to build ""Novorossia"", but the locals were smart enough to kick them out. Then these tourists arrived in Donetsk and, having received weapons from Russia, seized several districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to create their bandit ""state"" of the LDNR and killed thousands of representatives of the legitimate authorities.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCek73oy_YixpRXTVZ2dKeDA,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI
Jim Davison," @Motherlover Mercantile  sure do.  The US is done, it's no longer a super power.  The so called NeoNazi you talk of are just far right idiots we see all over the world who a afraid at the change in power we see globally.  You give them to much credit.   They have little support and power.  They are ignorant hated people.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9xJzbd8DgSWHmiObLEkxA,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI

Derek," @Jim Davison - You are so wrong on this subject.  The neo Nazi's are in control of this government which our media and politicians are calling 'democratic'. And they have taken control with the US backing to the tune of $5 Billion in funding.  Ask Victoria Newland if you want to know what's going on, ask her how she has hand picked the the Ukraine government?  They are proud of their achievement and won't deny it.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuyx9zNeSIN9ANQOSZ_GfEA,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI

Jim Davison, @Lonely Snail  that's just it the EU has woken up.  That's why Nato has done nothing.   The EU has been dealing with The Ukraine and has accepted the Ukraine into its membership in principle officially now meaning Putin has lost that part of the war.   No matter what happens now he is stuck dealing with the EU and suffering the consequences.   The US is to busy spending Russian money it seized so far and looking for more.   To them it's a windfall for a cash strapped country on the brink of collapse.  The only nations screwed all around is Russia.,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9xJzbd8DgSWHmiObLEkxA,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI
Jim Davison, @Derek  there is no such thing as neo Nazi.  It's a bogus catch all for propagandists.   What you have is white far right nationalist.   We have them in every nation trying to pretend it's still the 20th century.    They are a sad uneducated Lot but very much a minority.

They failed on ‚Äúhuman right‚Äù accusations so they may start defending the ‚Äúants rights‚Äù and ‚Äúbee right‚Äù claiming genocides to ants and bees next in China, because China is building infrastructure for the Chinese people. The US will accuse them of Violating ants rights and Bee Rights (hahahaha) and start a round of sanctions and attempt to seized money from Chinese.

4SkinTim_69_," @Derek  After following so many news about the war, never once have I seen any pictures of dead civilians though. So if what you said is really true, then there should be a lot of emphasis in ukraine and western news right now on the civilian bodies and images etc? But anyway from how Russia once said their gathering troops are just a ""training exercise"", and then said they no longer want to reply to the baseless accusations of any country that decide to misinterpret/vilify their training exercises...and then they invaded Ukraine all of a sudden, giving it a specific label of ""special military operation"" and totally not an invasion at all...I think they are a really deceptive government, and you can't believe anything they say on the media. I agree that every country tells lies to a certain extent, but just that Russia tells it in a more authoritarian and extreme level.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEUShlTp8_fDmdtlcuDp3uQ,BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGviyFI7NI

In this case, the media is informing the western public.  Any Russians who watch this will inevitably be bombarded with the Western narrative, and their narrative would fall apart.  They aren't able to obtain such information without becoming ""converted.""  It's like a defense of a base using monks in Age of Empires.  The enemy cannot get in without turning into one of us.

US took over, separated and occupied all territory of USSR. US replaced all USSR authorities with puppet authorities. It was a terrible idea for US  to repeat the Hitler‚Äô plan and occupy the country which own the nuclear bombs and the intercontinental nuclear missiles. This year started the liberation process from US occupation. Putin requested that US must leave the former USSR territory and countries of the former Warsaw territory. According to President Putin it will be a military response. US must leave or face the consequences!

Muonium,"If it is confirmed that these images are indeed from Ukraine's NPP, this is an absolutely unprecedented event in the history of the world. Never before anywhere to my knowledge has there ever been an actual military battle at the site of a functioning nuclear power plant. The only thing that comes remotely close is the anti-nuclear RPG attack on Superphenix in France in 1982 to prevent the construction of the site from continuing - but it was unfueled and thus there was no nuclear risk there. In this case though, the Ukrainians have been trying to isolate their power grid from external sources such as from Russia, in order to maintain it's integrity in the case of attack - given that, they're likely to be operating all available power plants on their grid including the nuclear ones. That means even if the reactors are scrammed the fuel bundles will be producing immense amounts (tens of megawatts) of decay heat which MUST be removed by continuous cooling - if power is lost at the site and backup diesel generators do not function, the core fuel will become uncovered and melt and produce an explosive hydrogen gas bubble just like in Fukushima.

Our government and people have asked NATO to close the sky over Ukraine many times in this 8 days to stop russian war crimes especially bombing civilians' houses. But NATO doesn't want to do it, because it may cause the bigger wat NATO vs russia. It's the same mistake Europe made in  30-ies of 20 century. If they don't stop this war now in any possible way, it will become much and much worse. So I ask you one more time: CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE!

Velcro," @Rachel Adkins  lol great post. love it. We need more people like you Rachel. 

On a slightly different not, I suppose I should just come to a place where I expect to see so much crap being posted online about the war. The amount of whataboutism going on is truly profound, much of it is coming from people who appear to be taking Putin's side of things. They claim they just want to be fair and yearn for the whole truth, but I don't believe it for one second. The people engaging in this type of behaviour are spending so much focus on it, that they are failing to ask the million dollar question: What do the people of Ukraine want? That is quite literally where the book should stop. But nope. They're too busy blaming the US, the UN and NATO for the war. Putin sucks these people up, but they are easy targets because of their arrogance. They truly believe they are 20 steps ahead of other Westerners and have the inside scoop on what is ""really"" happening. They long to go against what they deem to be the grain because it bolsters up their egos to continue to believe that they are set apart people of a higher intelligence. The reality however is starkly different. Westerners moving into a Pro-Putin stance are being used by a tyrant who is far more clever than they are.

major wingnut,"WW3 casualty breakdown estimates: Total nuclear exchange between belligerent powers could potentially involve in it‚Äôs entirety detonations in excess of 5k megatons over significant portions of the northern hemisphere. Initial death toll within 24 hours is estimated at 300-500 million with variances dependent on use of fallout shelters and evacuation procedures. Past this point casualties would continue to increase as a further 1-2 billion are expected to succumb to radiation poisoning and cancer in the proceeding weeks and months. A substantial number of these fatalities are expected outside the belligerent powers as radioactive particles are spread globally via atmospheric currents. Secondarily a nuclear winter resulting from the injection of soot particularly black carbon entering the upper atmosphere is expected to lower global temperatures between 11C to 22C for a period of 3-5 years under optimistic projections with some modeling showing global temperatures being affected for periods extending several decades. The result of this drastic temperature change is expected to deplete farm yields in excess of 80-90% causing a further 4-6 billion global fatalities due to starvation. With the casualty variation being highly dependent on proper use of food stocks and rationing from the remaining populace. Further still the majority of industrial fertilizer and farm equipment manufacturing that is responsible for the consequential increase in farm yields of the past century is located within the belligerent countries territories. Studies estimating planetary carrying capacity using preindustrial farming techniques provide a range of 600-800 million as sustainable in terms of global population. And with the majority of arable farmland located within the impacted northern hemisphere. Along with the effects of nuclear winter, planetary carrying capacity would be reduced further still. With some modeling predicting as few as 50-100 million being sustainable. In addition ocean fauna would also be dangerous to consume as rain/snow runoff funnels radioactive material along with debris containing large concentrations of lead and other heavy elements into coastal waters. With the destruction of much of the northern hemisphere global trade would for all intents and purposes cease to function. As all major ports, navigable rivers and highways within the belligerent states intersect economic zones that would now be impassable due to radioactive contamination and debris. As per UN food sustainability studies between 58%-62% of countries are dependent on food imports. Even within countries classified as food sustainable estimates put 70%-74% of populations farther than 200km of their respective food producing regions. A further strain on food distribution would be the loss of major fuel refining facilities based in the impacted countries. Fuel shortages would compound already strained food stocks leading to a breakdown in the supply chain. Under these conditions remaining governments would face a monumental task in attempting to maintain law and order. Possibly resulting in the breakdown of civil society and extreme lawlessness in most of the world. Rate of homicides during this period can't be calculated with certainty but expected to be significant. Lastly the majority of pharmaceutical manufacturing for both antiviral and antibiotics, along with medical equipment is produced by the belligerent countries. Loss of these facilities would compound the spread of disease along with the subsequent conditions. Further adding to the substantial number of unpredictable deaths. It is outside the scope of this summary to predict a time frame for the reemergence of civilized societies and or nation states. Final estimate for a total nuclear exchange is between 5.3 to 7.7 billion casualties. With a moderate chance of complete human extinction.

John Culp," @FinnicLight  first I want to say right off the bat that I‚Äôm American so you don‚Äôt think this is coming from some pro Russian bias. But your looking at this from the perspective of western military doctrine. While Ukraine has been nothing short of inspiring and incredibly valiant in their defense, Russia is in the position of strength here. While it‚Äôs true that they‚Äôve taken unexpected and in some cases very heavy losses (I.e 500 paratroopers shot down over hostomel airport) it‚Äôs really important to note the lengths Russia was going to to try and limit civilian casualties. They thought they‚Äôd have a lot  more support from the Ukrainian populace and didn‚Äôt want to stir up resistance by inflicting needless harm on civilians. And to a large extent they still are hence the setting up of humanitarian corridors but as resistance stiffens the gloves will come off. It‚Äôs winter in Ukraine. If Putin was out just to kill people knocking out the heat, water and electricity and shelling the Chernobyl sarcophagus would be 10million plus. Also you‚Äôre talking about a country who‚Äôs way of fighting war is essentially massive artillery barrages, terror tactics, air strikes, sending in waves of conscripts with few supplies and shoddy equipment to identify enemy strongpoints and run the enemy out of resources, and a ton of espionage, sabotage, assasinations, and special forces striking soft targets behind enemy lines. Oh and the use of NUKES to DE-ESCALATE conflict. It seems like Putin‚Äôs all in on Ukraine. He considers the issue to be an existential crisis for Russia I genuinely think we could see the use of atomic weapons on Ukrainian soil before we‚Äôd see Putin overthrown or throw in the towel",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYmkLwGP5070vaGpnbIqRQ,DW News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXo0rkQF8K8

Currently their atrocities are not restrained by morality, but a lack of ability. They will do in Ukraine what they did in Syria and Chechenia. They did not respect the cease fires of the humanitarian corridors in Syria. They will not respect them in Ukraine either. For them a cease fire is a means of gaining tactical advantage by exploiting the gullibility of the enemy. They think of themselves as clever for this perfidy.

Anthony Gordon, @√†  Trump only created space force cause his ass couldn't get anything else done. Space Force is pretty stupid considering the Air Force pretty much already does Space and Air Military defense already. And technically Space Force is a department of the air force. So all he pretty much did is took a existing department of the air force and gave it a name. Bravo. So he technically did not create the space force. But rather just gave the department a name.,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIy9ZK1NdGw3EF5iiVJK4BA,CNBC Television,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrlnQBt2C0g
√†," @Anthony Gordon  you know the airforce was just part of the Navy before becoming its own branch? I guess according to you that's pretty stupid to create the air force since the navy already handled air defense. Space force is officially it's own branch of the military and already has over 16,000 enlisted members. A branch specifically focused on Space is needed now. Just like a branch specifically for air was needed when air force was started from the navy.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUb_Mu0U0QCiZ_gWh6sC7Rg,CNBC Television,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrlnQBt2C0g
Anthony Gordon," @√†  I am not saying the space force wasn't needed. I was saying the department of space defense already existed within the air force, he just gave the department a unique name and made it its own branch. You guys talk as if he created the branch from the ground up or something. Even if he never did that, we would still have a space force, it simply just wouldn't be called Space Force.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIy9ZK1NdGw3EF5iiVJK4BA,CNBC Television,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrlnQBt2C0g

Plus, we were already going into space anyway.

Donbas and other regions are full ethnic Russians. There's no comparison at all to NATO in Afghanistan. Zero. Don't get excited about clever sound turns of phrase.

Scott McLoughlin," @Generic toaster Strudel  It's going fine. Neo-Imperial ""Globalization"" is coming to an end. The issues here are economic and mostly concern oil, wheat, iron and fertilizer. Donbas and other regions of Ukraine are full of ethnic Russians. Bombing Ukraine to smithereens is simply a non-goal. This is a border issue for Russia. It's not like NATO in Afghanistan or Iraq. There are no useful comparisons to be made. I lived in Ukraine. Ukraine is more-or-less a ""fake"" country from an historical perspective. You can read about that on Wikipedia. That doesn't mean ethnic Ukrainians won't have a territory of their own, but not by current borders. Find a map of Eurasia online and take a long hard look. 70K Taliban fighters just kicked NATO of Afghanistan. Don't get excited about gear. Gear lusts lost in Afghanistan. Think of tongue cancer, soiled panties and stinky dirty tampons. Calm down. Grow up. Don't have fun. Seek insights. Do you want to be wise, or are you just flapping your gums?

He's Army. He's not lying. It's short but not too short. Russia is a horse swatting a fly on their borders. Russia is a big commodity exporter. They want to export commodities. They are not conquistadors. Americans fail to understand that Eurasian populations are not colonizing populations. They live on their historical lands. NATO is the maritime colonizer club.

VVayVVard," @Low Battery  This is not true. As an academic, I would caution against trusting any history book that gives the impression that either side in WW2 was more correct or moral than the other. In the West, all history books are written based on skewed sources, often anecdotal in nature, disseminated by the old enemies of Germany, Italy and Japan. Only by looking at records and testimonies from both sides, and by formulating realistic hypotheses on how the events we learn of may actually have unfolded, can we draw realistic conclusions on which choices were good, and which were bad.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYc4T6Wqz3oHtj8VDknlaeg,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EGCRkI2R-k

And if Ukraine had projectile explosives capable of this type of fire then wouldn't they have been using them to push the Russians back from Kyiv by now.

He's made it impossible for his constituents to overthrow him, he's guaranteed his position until he dies so there's no worries that they'll elect him out, he's positioned his troops strategically throughout the Baltics and occupied bordering countries like Belarus and Chimera over the last decade, he's emassed a  team of allies who all have issues with the West and Europe and he's hoarded himself a small fortune so he doesn't have to suffer poverty with his constituents. This was a warning because of the UN vote yesterday, he had every intention of eventually letting them contain it... this time... but now they know that he's willing to do it because someone like Putin will refuse to lose because if he loses someone within his fold will take him out and he knows it, so what's it to him at that point to take EVERYONE out with him.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsagTx6kfPmCqG2uKkigpQ,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3tR3y_T7RU

Lominoth Productions," @Mindy Girard  I'm not saying he's trying to invade the us. Directly but I do know that he's probably trying to force NATO's hand in the situation and the United States hang. Bombing a nuclear plant is just as bad as launching a warhead if a nuclear plant explodes it can launch radioactive debris hundreds if not thousands of miles away. It's essentially setting off a nuclear warhead without setting off a nuclear warhead. That's why I'm saying is he's trying to force our hands or Force us to capitulate to him being able to invade any country he wants without any interference.

Lominoth Productions," @Mindy Girard  yes, and as I said, saying your going to charge him with war crimes means nothing if you don't have the power or ability to bring him to justice. That means the only way to resolve this conflict without getting NATO involved is to get non NATO countries in the area involved.

Mindy Girard," @Zurround! 1000  Yes and if he had of pushed it much longer than he did to let them in, or if there had of been any trace of radiation he would of been held liable for it. But in the reality being charged with war crimes is more a symbol than an actual action. There are leaders all over the world, even American leaders who have technically been charged by the UN with war crimes. It should carry an actual conviction, perhaps it would dissuade leaders from pushing their limits in these situations, but unfortunately it doesn't mean much.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsagTx6kfPmCqG2uKkigpQ,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3tR3y_T7RU

That's why I said Putin has played the ultimate hand of poker.

Those are literally the only two options there are.

Mindy Girard," @Lominoth Productions  I know that this is going to sound morbid and pessimistic but right now I think that it's time for straight talk.... I think the best possible outcome of this would be for the Ukrainians to be able to hold him off long enough for his supporters to sense a loss, meaning that they eventually feel some of the trickle down of inflation and have one of them take him out before he senses that their going to, because if he knows their going to in advance he'll take us all with him, but I honestly don't see that happening anytime soon as I'm sure they have all weighed the possible outcomes and made a certain timeframe of concessions...so I ultimately think that this is it. I know that sounds defeated but I honestly think that we're all screwed this time... maybe there's a miracle that I'm not capable of imagining.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsagTx6kfPmCqG2uKkigpQ,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3tR3y_T7RU
Mindy Girard," @Lominoth Productions  I see what you're asking now...if being convicted as a war criminal doesn't hold actual weight then why doesn't one or more of these countries come in and help physically anyway? Right? A conviction wouldn't mean anything to Putin himself not everyone else, does that make sense? Let's explain it this way if Putin actually does win and manages to occupy Ukraine then internationally he technically won't be recognized as occupying Ukraine... physically he'll hold it but symbolically the Ukrainian people will still be independent and while that might seem like a small thing to those of us looking from the sidelines it's really a matter of morale for the Slavic countries (there's also the matter of succession once things were to die down and the Ukrainians could regroup but that's a whole other big conversation that we all have to survive through to reach) . Now if Sweden or Moldova insert themselves they don't get to claim that same right because they choose to include themselves in war so Putin WOULD be recognized as it's occupier if he wins and there would be nothing anyone could do about it where as if they just wait until he attacks first they have all of the same succession rights that Ukraine now possess.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsagTx6kfPmCqG2uKkigpQ,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3tR3y_T7RU

If russia would send an bomber over there or they would shell it with artylery for couple of hours i would believe in that narrative. Look how russia took over chernobyl. Not a single shoot fired. Troops on the ground knew what can happen and both side decide to sort it out without shootin an single bulet. In this case some hot headed soldiers exchanged fire with eachother. After couple of days of war we cant expect an common sense in both sides. These soldiers seen horrors of war and they are 'hot headed' right now. So they start shooting at each other but i doubt any of the side had a plans to destroy powerplant and cause a big problem for everyone. My small advice. Listen to both sides of a story, think about it... then divide it by 4 and that my be 50 % of a truth we know.

It is impossible to win Guerrilla warfare when you are in enemy‚Äôs territory and the enemy is at large extent united to send the invader home.

Zach Van Wolf," @Bravo Lima  Fair points. Greetings from Switzerland. But as I have Eastern European roots, from stories and light experiences on my own, I am worried that this harsh language can quickly escalate into an apocalypse. We need all to calm down. The Ukraine had no business joining the NATO, but rightfully - as it turned out - needs some guarantees to be left in peace by Russia, too. Both not happening. But now I wonder, what Putin's goal is, if he even successfully conquers Ukraine. A country of 40 Mio., how does he plan to move on, does he believe he can control so many people, without tremendous oppression there and in Russia (many Russians like Ukrainian people after all). For sure the tax burden in Russia for all the military and policing apparatus will either force Putin to resign, or the Russian Federation will become a true nation of masses living in absolute misery.

Bravo Lima, @Zach Van Wolf  Putin did ask for a guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO and he asked for a disarmament. He also asked the Americans to observe how the Ukrainian military was shelling the Donbas (DPR) and killing people that were Ukrainian but born originally in Russia.  Neither of his requests were granted.  What many people do not realize is that there were hundreds of thousands of Russian born people trapped in the Ukraine area when USSR collapsed. They remained there and everyone lived in harmony with no issues. Then after Maidan the Government that came into power began to openly discriminate against all Russian people including their language.  This is what originally led to the formation of the DPR in Donbas.,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IOGDJiYyS-wIUl81kfd7Q,DW News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0tUvSjAJto

It's not worth fighting over it. But still doesn't justify Putin or the Russians to invade the whole of the Ukraine. My impression is, that is a justification for Russian atrocities and unjust war mongering. In the end, I don't believe that is in Russia's interest. It's more the mafia is ruling the country. So, my impression, also more and more mafia tendencies in the EU. Spending 18x the money for military than Rusdia apparently not enough for NATO.

Russia is going to conquer Ukraine it kills me how much u all underestimate ur opponent,  u think the Russia intelligence force dosnt think about all these outcomes?? U talk about the large convoy u don't think the generals leading those convoys don't think about air strikes,  road blockages e.t.c??? See this is human beings problems u underestimate ur opponent Ukraine is not stupid but nore is Russia, Russia is playing a game of chess right now,. They expect to lose units. It's all part of the plan.  They have to fully circle Ukraine without carving a path through millions of innocent ukranians.   Wich means loss of there troops is inevitable. Russia knows this.   This could get farrrr more bloodier then it is Putin is holding back for humanitarian reasons.   This is a game of chess and strategy ur watching okayout between Russian and UK, Russia will undoubtedly take Ukraine, our propoganda is praising Ukraine to boost there morale, but in reality we all know Ukraine is doomed, Russia does not just have the second largest force in the world they have high intelligence as well, Ukraine has intelligence as well but nearly not enough military force not even close,.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5NkW6y-1XVs04X9D6heqKw,WION,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XKb3yrVeeM

hakim solana,"the question of why Russia started its military operation in Ukraine just now, when the beginning of the mud season makes any movement of heavy equipment difficult. On the surface, the reason could be that heavy shelling of the eastern provinces by the Ukrainian army has been going on again for weeks. But that alone cannot be the reason. So what does Russia know that we don‚Äôt yet know? Could it actually be nuclear warheads that have already been brought to Kiev? This is supported by the fact that although C-17 military transports have been delivering tons of weapons to Kiev for weeks. But only a few flights of these deliveries have not taken the shortest route via Germany on their way to Kiev. They took a detour via the Baltic Sea and Poland. Why? Is it unreasonable to assume that they were not allowed to fly over Germany because they had nuclear warheads on board?",main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvb4k7kZhfDUyHHzLWsyOOA,Manila Bulletin Online,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESSIDkM6__8

The argument of sovereignty isn't a good one as it is very often complicated.
For example, country A can construct 20 dams upstream and justify such things with sovereignty. In the meanwhile, country B, who is downstream, gets no water for the next 2-3 years.

Victor Almeida," @Pashnigen  It's even more stupid than that. For over 3 decades, since Mikhail Gorbachev and his notorious ""not one inch eastwards"" agreement in 1990, Russia has been warning the US about the prospect of conflict if NATO expanded east from Germany. The US - president Bush - promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand to the east. Before he invaded, Putin wanted a buffer zone between his country and the alliance, and after repeated ""betrayals"" by the West, he went and held a gun to Ukraine's head and issued an ultimatum. Neutralising Ukraine would have resolved the issue, but I the US government is power-hungry so US/NATO not only let him fire but even vocally predicted it and let it happen without making any concessions. And Zelensky thinks these are his pals. Now he's arming civilians with molotov cocktails to fend off professional soldiers armed with assault rifles",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnKHO8U-OcCZNMWGvOO_kg,ABC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQ5wGhEREI

However that war was wrong I didn‚Äôt support personally and lots of Americans didn‚Äôt. And of course is power of control or balance in control. Also I don‚Äôt support Israel war against Palestine, but does mean why happened there has to happen to Ukraine. Russia in 1991 if I‚Äôm not wrong gave the Ukraine independence and Ukrainian are not Russian they have their own language. As independent country can make its own decision with which side wants to join. They think western works better for their interest. Putin doesn‚Äôt like it has to declare war thirsty for power. Nordics are not in Nato but no one from European country attack them. If they want to join in Nato Putin will declare war bc doesn‚Äôt want Nato influence. I‚Äôm an Albanian so Nato helped Kosovo not getting killed from Serbia. They have massacred Kosovo ppl ripped pregnant women from belly and so on where was Russia with Serbia. But whatever I want them both to live In Peace. Kosovo was recognized from a lot of European countries but Russia China and India don‚Äôt recognize it as independent country but part of Serbia and it‚Äôs not. Historically in 1913 European countries including Russia detached Kosovo from Albania and gave to Serbia. As you see there are so deep feelings here. But we can‚Äôt live in past.

Therefore we are not in charge to intervine in this conflict. That's a fact. But a lot of cuntries around Ukraine are supporting behind the lines mostly with defensive weapons predominantely human empathy or fear. IF NATO decides to step in and declare war to Russia, more than 20+ states are in war with the Russians. That first of all means it would be the 3rd world war if Belarus, Iran, Serbia and more team up with Russia. Second.. there is no question the Military capacity of NATO is bigger than any Defense Organisation on this Planet. Russia would loose... but and there we have the biggest problem... they would use theire atomic bombs and NATO would use theirs cause of the worldwide mentality: ""If I loose u loose too.""

If they would not care, at all, then that would mean that Russia could lose 150 million people (all of its population) without any one what so ever caring about it (inclusive Putin).

Russian lost so far close to 5000 in a week, yet their government has mobile crematorium on the battle field to erase any record of their death.

IAMGiftbearer," @Mad Mick  Putin is the lunatic. Let's be clear. Ukraine didn't ask for this slaughter. It's an unfair fight. Zelenski is being realistic. He's not being hysterical. It's easy for others to view it that way from their cozy, safe livingrooms, but when you're under attack your survival instinct kicks in. It's not an overreaction. Think about this rationally, logically. How long do you really think they can fight this alone? The Russian army vastly outnumbers the Ukrainian army. Be under no illusions. Putin will move further than Ukraine if given the opportunity. He hates NATO and Ukraine is surrounded with NATO countries throughout Eastern Europe. People need to throw away the false belief that staying out of this will save themselves, because Putin is not rational and he takes ANY resistance, even humanitarian aid to the other side as a threat (because he is a paranoid person to begin with). His end game is world domination. Are you really willing to give it to him? You can't treat this like a controlled burn as in a wildfire. People like Putin do not just burn themselves out. The more ground they take, the more emboldened they get. The world will eventually have to face this reality and step up to the plate.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewUpB2L6-nAHTGB5EiQK1g,DW News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqP5Yx57aeo

So put maximal pressure to Ukraine on multiple sides while slowly consolidating control of the South then when it comes to negotiations they annex the South and retreat from other fronts. Just like that, Ukraine is land locked, they have annexed land so Ukraine can never join Nato",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQK1THVClBwbUMXlCJqwCRA,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1yz3LbNhfY

alberto 9,"NATO can't declare a war. It's a defensive alliance. Even if it could declare war who would do that in Europe? Europe doesn't have an army, the single nations have an army. What could happen? UK and France declare war to Russia like in 1939 they did with Germany? Russia has five times the nuclear power of all the 27 European nations together. But let's imagine all the 27 European nations declare war to Russia, what America will do? They would declare war as well? Why should they do that? Remember one think. In 1939 the scenery was the same. Hitler, a dictator, invaded Polonia. Now Putin, a dictator, invades Ucraina. There are chances he will not stop like Hitler didn't stop. What did America do in 1939? Nothing, America waited. America declared war in December 1941, more the two years and half after the war had started in Europe. And why did America make war? Because it was stricken in its most important interests in Pacific area. It's absolutely the same situation. And tell me another thing. Who is not afraid? Everybody is. Like in 1939 a man is deciding the destiny of hundreds of millions of people. I say we are in a cul-de-sac and I see it bad, very bad. I hope I am wrong.

Jussi H√§kkinen," @mac  This information is for those who do not know the whole story. 
 I own the information, so I have a different opinion.  
There was a coup d'√©tat in Ukraine.  We will not argue for what purpose it was called, but it is illegal in any case. 
 Donbass did not agree with such a violation and refused to accept the rebellious power.  In response, Kyiv brought in troops and nationalist battalions and began hostilities.  It's a crime because you can't use the army against your own people.  After that, volunteers went from Russia to help Donbass.  Active hostilities began.  The militia of Donbass began the defeat of the Ukrainian army.  Poroshenko realized that his army was defeated and turned to Putin for help.  Putin stopped the offensive of the Donbass army and proposed a peaceful settlement ""Minsk"".  Poroshenko found himself in a hopeless situation and signed a contract.  But he did not fulfill it.  Instead, he, and then Zelensky, with the help of the West, armed and trained the army and again attacked the Donbass.  This time, Putin recognized the independence of the republics and signed an agreement on cooperation and protection of territories.  After that, the military operation began.  At the moment, not the entire territory of Donbass has been liberated.  And so Putin did not want to occupy either the Donbass or Ukraine, otherwise he would not have proposed a peace treaty, but would have occupied it back in 1414.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyfMiYLZxlYU8pCV3xoACZQ,DW News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJwqQ8YbHhg

Charles Kinzer," @T AU  I understand the folklore of blaming that treaty for WWII in Europe and the notion that its harshness punished Germany too much and opened the door for Hitler.  And it was harsh.  And Hitler did exploit that.  However, it was the mistakes afterward such as allowing Germany to build a massive military operation.  And who invaded Poland?  And what was the response of the rest of Europe to the invasion of Poland?  ""Appeasement"" then, as it is today, and will again be tomorrow, is the root cause leading to the malfeasance of tyrants.  With cowardice and a willingness to trade self-interest for the suffering of others being a close second.  It always is.  For example, the U.S. is sending 7 billion in arms to Ukraine.  But the U.S. sends 35 billion to Russia for oil EVERY DAY and the administration won't stop it.  So who is the U.S. administration helping more?  The administration is too politically concerned with another few cents of gas price increases.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrx8JUFcqA8HNDu5nLTLwVQ,MSNBC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWz5NSjlJ7Q

Mike," @Charles Kinzer  ""Who invaded Poland?"" - the German Wehrmacht and the Soviet Red Army invaded Poland. (and it took a month to defeat them). ""And what was response of the rest of Europe to the invasion of Poland?"" - A Declaration of War by Great Britain and France on Germany. That was the response - WWII was the response to the invasion of Poland by Germany. And don't forget the invasion of Romania and Finland and Lithuania, and Latvia, and Estonia by the Soviet Union - only the West didn't declare war on them.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClaVHDV45RaKOkhhxBmoR2w,MSNBC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWz5NSjlJ7Q
Charles Kinzer," @Mike  Yes.  I know all of those well-known facts.  That ""fact"" you overlook is that Germany should have never been permitted the ability to build the military they had.  Part of the treaty prohibited that (and, obviously for good reason), yet Germany was still permitted to take all the steps making their aggression possible.  I consider the weakness of ""leaders"" like Neville Chamberlain to be nothing short of criminal.  Chamberlain, and those that were like him, allowed these things to happen.

Mike, @Charles Kinzer  No. You didn't know any of those facts.

Mike," @Charles Kinzer  And further - there's been no appeasement towards Russia. Bush senior promised no NATO expansion eastward when Gorbachev allowed the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and independence for Soviet republics. We lied. We expanded NATO to Russia's borders. We even allowed former Baltic SSR Republics of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia to join NATO. Putin said he wouldn't tolerate Ukraine membership in NATO. Kamala Harris went to Europe last year and said she looked forward Ukraine membership - and now there's a war. And it will soon engulf the world.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClaVHDV45RaKOkhhxBmoR2w,MSNBC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWz5NSjlJ7Q
Charles Kinzer," @Mike  The biggest failing in your analysis is your attempt to try and start the WWII clock with Poland.  You overlook the prior annexation of Czechoslovakia and Austria where the rest of Europe, and a sterling example of Chamberlain's horrible appeasement policy, helped put Germany on the road towards WWII.  The parallels between then and now aren't an exact match.  But they contain the same general characteristics and same general cast of characters.  I'm sure it is cold comfort to those getting bombed in Ukraine that there is a push for ""investigations for possible future war crime trials.""",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrx8JUFcqA8HNDu5nLTLwVQ,MSNBC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWz5NSjlJ7Q
Mike," @Charles Kinzer  I'm not analyzing anything. YOU said the RESULT of the invasion of Poland was appeasement. I said the result was war. Now you're back tracking. But your analogy is still ridiculous. We promised Russia (Gorbachev), that allowing German reunification, disbanding the Warsaw Pact, and letting the Soviet Republics gain independence, that we would not expand NATO eastward. We lied. We expanded to Russia's borders. That's the OPPOSITE of appeasement - that's a provocation. Putin said no more NATO expansion - Ukraine is off limits. Kamala Harris went to Europe last year and said we'd welcome Ukraine - so now Russia invaded.

Ukraine wants to be independent and join NATO (this has been going on for a long time not having to do with the US), and the Russian anti-democratic  gov won't be able to claim their land if they do (NATO countries are untouchable). Suggesting a country wanting to be independent is an act of aggression is incorrect, it benefits no one to attack Russia directly, especially Ukraine.

It's all very complex since their is so much history behind it all, -but it came to a point where they were going to get invaded anyway since their gov has been becoming more progressive and criticizing putin, refusing to accept puppet leaders.

Seventh Anubis," @Trishen Naidoo  They just say it to make people think neo-liberalism isn't an utter failure. Ukraine is a 1st world country with a top 20, formidable military. In addition, armed and trained for 8 years by the US. Iraq was completely depleted, sanctioned, and broken down for years before the US and a coalition invaded. The US also has far more offensive capabilities than Russia. Russia leaked the invasion to the US and flouted nuclear weapons, so the US would go for weapon's sales profits instead of using the missiles in Europe. And it worked. The US missile command in Romania and Poland were told to stand down, because Russia might use nukes. Like China would allow Russia to use nukes and start WW3.... The neo-liberal nuts in the US, NATO, and even Ukraine are thinking more about how to cash in on this than stop it.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZhghqO2Seujo_q_E8JTnGg,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXME2_D5ss

Johan Kr√ºger Haglert, @kaname noname  China was Russias friend because they copied communism though China have made it more capitalistic. They still share Russias worries because they want to conquer Taiwan and rule the South China sea. Also they used to purchase Russian equipment but by now they seem to trush their own air-defense system at-least as much and have their own jets and are trying to make their own jet engines. With the economic impact on Russia I guess China will pass them and be self-reliant there but sure cheap natural resources from someone is something. But Russia likely to become the weaker side. As for the Indians I don't really know where they are. Somewhere inbetween? Varies? Middle-east varies too but sure people may fear USA because of its power and capacity to rule.,reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9gMtZp7gyP9N-KN471Y6_g,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdXME2_D5ss

George James Ducas,"The Rus were Viking tribes that settled in Kiev as far back as 750 AD, 400 years before Moskva existed. Moskva were Finnish Urgic Tribes; Mosk means cow and Va water, which are Finnish names. There is no RUS there. The ethnic background of Moskva is Finnish and Mongolian. The Rus developed the religion, city Kiev, alphabet, and had its saints. They spread Kievian culture  much like the Greeks Hellenized the known world, or like the British anglicized the world by the English language. This process does not make Moskva to become RUS in as much as Persian are not Greek. How we are misled by a name; Russia. The capitol of the RUS has always been Kiev. There is no other RUS and no RUS in Moskva. Many say Ukraine began recently; but the culture of the RUS is Kievian RUS, both culture and ethnic background. Ukraine is a name given by Poland meaning outer lands. The lands of the RUS before the Mongolian invasion was very large. The name RUS is a Norse name which means men that row; there are no men that row in Moskva. So Moskva adopted the name Russia while being a Mongolian vassal, essentially traitor to the RUS; and all the czars were Mongolian-Finnish. The Culture  of the Mongolian was centralized power, and that was passed on to present day Russia. Ukraine‚Äôs real name should be Kievian RUS, or Kievskarus!",main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE0jdnFpPQD6HKrakRml6uw,Sky News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crWAMd1ef1c

I totally agree it is becoming more and more dangerous with each passing day. Putin is a megalomaniac and will not stop at just Ukraine.

tech-nerd,"I blame both and I understand both sides. If you trully want to undestand what is going on there without the enormous social media anti-Russian sentiment, I would suggest watching the lecture by the John Mearsheimer, Harvard's Professor of political sciences (American).

He predicted how exactly the whole situation would play out today. Why is Ukraine the West's Fault? Featuring John Mearsheimer. If anyone has strong counter arguments against John Mearsheimer's point of view, please, share your sources here (no sociam media and/or govt media of any kind) and I will take my time to study them.",main,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRjJdGv2LSS08WGRVoHxi1g,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLqattbz_k8

The training the U.S. provided to the Azov Battalion is coming back to roost in the U.S. as the neo-Nazi group is training and radicalizing U.S.-based groups with similar ideologies steeped in hatred and a belief in white racial supremacy."" Based on my training and experience, I know that the Azov Battalion is a paramilitary unit of the Ukrainian National Guard which is known for its association with neo-Nazi ideology and use of Nazi symbolism, and which is believed to have participated in training and radicalizing United States-based white supremacy organizations,‚Äù says Bierwirth, who was an officer in the US Army prior to joining the FBI.

The point which Putin was really looking for to get answers and guarantees from Washington who‚Äôre controlling Kyiv government in every step was also mentioned that in case Biden and EU fails to fulfill anything regarding the guarantees therefore the Russian Army will attack these areas where the threat comes from. eventually these points were ignored and the Russian Army made their decision to enter Ukraine by themselves to clear those who‚Äôre threatening Russians and Donbas people.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqD-tz5TuKiZC1IPLb-C34Q,ABC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IDJ2yBcCrc

NONE of Trumps children or son in law are qualified to do any of the positions he gave them.

Russian experts have warned about this for decades.

Putin has been incredibly patient the last 3 decades & especially the last two years. Ukraine is not suppose to join NATO .

Even if Russia wins , Ukraine will remain ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù as independent country. Zelenskyy doesn‚Äôt wants to retain his presidency. He wants to be a hero. He is a comedian who has great job of raising patriotic feelings amongst Ukrainians, but a pathetic job of provoking Russia on behest of USA, Britain. He thought USA would help him, which never happened. He is still going forward asking all Ukrainian men to sacrifice their lives in this war.

Exodus," @James Robinson  alot or little is only based on our human perception. God ways is always way above our comprehension.  We may see little or no results but God may see it differently. In my present perception I may see no results with the Russian steaming away but none of us know the mind of God. Even if Ukraine is brought to its knees n in our opinion it means God has not done anything or He has failed to protect Ukraine n we only see it as the ""end"" but does it mean the ""end"" to God? God doesn't work His ways according to our plan, desire or even prayers. Ultimately it is always His Will that matters. Like Jesus praying ""if it be possible please remove this cup but NOT MY WILL BUT YOUR WILL BE DONE"" n those of us familiar with this biblical account will know that Jesus prayer was ""not answered"", ""God didn't save Jesus as Jesus has prayed for"" n so Jesus went to the cross to die for our sins so that we can have a relationship with God our creator again no longer separated by sin. So even as we pray for Ukraine according to what we all good loving human beings long for, we need to pray ""not my will but your will"" be done. If we were alive in Jesus time n knew of Jesus prayers. We would have say the same thing of God ""so what has God done? Nothing right? Cos Jesus was crucified on the cross n God has not done anything to save Jesus"". Our conclusion would have been the same as it is now seeing nothing much has been done by God for Ukraine or if Ukraine fall to the Russian,  we would have said ""God has done nothing for them"". Thats all I can say. My love n prayers for the people of Ukraine but ""Let thy will be done not mine but yours"".

"Two parties, one oligarchy","The thing you are not allowed to talk about: In 2013 The US (Victoria Nuland) gave the Ukrainian neo-Nazi gang C14 $billions in weapons and CIA training so they would overthrow what the UN certified to be a democratically elected progressive Ukrainian government. After a successful coup d'etat in February 2014, the US-backed Nazis engage in 8 years of ""ethnic cleansing"" of the darker-skinned Russian speaking eastern Ukrainians who wanted to fight for their elected government and resist the coup. The US has funded the murder of 14,000 Ukrainians.  In the coup, the US replaced the elected leader with a IMF/WTO puppet who privatized oil profits (hence Hunter Biden's $50K/mo paycheck). Before the 2014 coup d'etat, the elected government used socialized oil profits to pay for universal healthcare and education instead of taxation, so the US used their Nazi alliance to put a stop to that.  Then the US put $billions of long-range missiles on the Russian-Ukraine border (and also on Russia's border with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania 2004) all in direct violation of the NATO treaty signed when Russia peacefully gave up Eastern Germany.",reply,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4oKmIVsLtx0bOfWw-3M1A,NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byzkPVzjN78
